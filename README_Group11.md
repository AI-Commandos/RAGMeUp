# Group 11 changes to RAGMeUp

## Idea
There were a lot of possibilities for changing or expanding the RAGMeUp framework for this assignment, eventually we decided to implement ColBERT as reranker. Implementing ColBERT offers the chance to work with a state-of-the-art retrieval framework that uses deep learning to enhance semantic understanding. By leveraging BERT’s contextual embeddings, ColBERT allows the system to retrieve passages not only based on exact keyword matches but on deeper semantic relevance, which is particularly useful when dealing with ambiguous or context-sensitive queries. This aligns well with projects like chatbot applications or question-answering systems where precision and context matter.

Another compelling reason for implementing ColBERT is the efficiency in managing large datasets. Unlike traditional dense retrieval models, ColBERT uses late interaction techniques that balance computational costs and accuracy, making it scalable for real-world applications. This means we are able to explore how such a model can bridge the gap between research and practical deployment, addressing challenges like latency and user experience in information-heavy applications.

Finally, the project provides an opportunity for hands-on learning with advanced concepts in machine learning and information retrieval, including transformer-based models, indexing, and clustering. Working with ColBERT deepens our understanding of how neural networks can be optimized for retrieval tasks, offering valuable insights into AI techniques. This means we can explore how these systems can be applied to real-world problems, creating a more engaging, powerful, and responsive chatbot, while also building technical expertise that’s highly relevant nowadays
