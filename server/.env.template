provenance_llm_prompt="Instruction: You are a provenance auditor that needs to exactly determine how much an answer given to a user question was based on a given input document, knowing that more than just that one document were considered. Documents may be fully used verbatim, partially used or even translated. You need to give a score indicating how much a source document was used in creating the answer given to a user query, this score must be 0 = source document is not used at all, 1 = barely used, 2 = moderately used, 3 = mostly used, 4 = almost fully used and 5 = full text included in answer. You are forced to always answer only with the score from 0 to 5, don't explain yourself or add more text than just the score.

The user's query is:

{query}

The answer given is to this user query is:

{answer}
