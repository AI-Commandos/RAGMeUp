# GraphRAG: Extending RAG Me Up with Neo4j Graph Integration

This project introduces **GraphRAG**, an extension to the [RAG Me Up framework](https://github.com/AI-Commandos/RAGMeUp), by integrating Neo4j as a graph database into the RAG pipeline. GraphRAG leverages graph-based data storage and querying capabilities, enabling improved data relationships and enhanced retrieval.

GraphRAG is created for an assignment of the Natural Language Processing course of JADS by **Tjielke Nabuurs, Jeroen Dortmans and Luuk Jacobs of group 17.** Our main goal of the assignment was to modify the components of the RAG pipeline that is used by default by the RAG Me Up repository.

# Motivation

Our academic interest lies in graph-based retrieval systems given how graph structures can represent complex relationships and interconnections in a way that mirrors human logic and knowledge. Graph databases like Neo4j are not only highly intuitive for modeling complex systems but also incredibly powerful for performing traceable, structured queries. By using graphs, we can represent the inherent relationships in data and make use of their attributes, enriching the data upon retrieval.

Especially in production environments, reliability and interpretability are paramount. GraphRAG's graph-based approach offers:

1. **Enrichment of Retrieved Data**: GraphRAG not only retrieves the target information but also leverages the graph structure to enrich it with additional relevant attributes.
2. **Traceability**: Each retrieval result is directly linked to its origin in the graph, making it easy to verify and understand why specific information was selected.
3. **Logical Consistency**: The graph structure enforces relationships and dependencies, ensuring that results adhere to the logical connections defined within the data. Which ensure more reliable responses and reduce hallucinations.

# Overview of Changes

To offer a loose coupling between the existing server and the neo4j database, we create a seperate server that connects to the database, which is accessible to the server using a REST API. The implementation only uses the RagHelperCloud configuration and is tested using the GEMINI API. 
We modified the RAG Me Up framework to include a Neo4j-based graph integration in the following ways:

1. **Seperate REST API accessible server for database connection** This create modularity and scalability, making ....
2. **Added a graph-based pdf loader**, This uses the LLM to extract triplets from the data, which are inputted into the database. The schema can be defined beforehand in the .env or dynamically retrieved from the database
3. **Implemented a graph-based csv loaders** to import csv's into the database, a seperate csv parser and .. . 
4. **Implemented Graph based retrieval** where we create cypher queries by combining schema information and the user question. Furthermore, using few shot prompting technique, the LLM will return None when the question can not be relevantly answered using a Cypher query.

### Implementation Details: Graph-Based Retrieval

In this project, we extended the default RAG pipeline by integrating Neo4j for graph-based retrieval. A new retriever function, `graph_retriever`, was developed to enable querying a Neo4j database using schema-aware Cypher queries. This integration enhances the retrieval process by leveraging graph-based relationships and attributes. Below are the key aspects of this implementation:

1. **Neo4j Schema Integration**  
   - Dynamically retrieves the database schema using the `/schema` endpoint.
   - Formats the schema into a prompt-friendly text representation for the LLM.

2. **LLM-Driven Query Generation**  
   - Combines schema information and user queries to create schema-aware prompts.
   - Employs a few-shot learning approach to guide the LLM in generating Cypher queries.

3. **Query Execution and Data Retrieval**  
   - Executes the LLM-generated Cypher query against the Neo4j database.
   - Converts query results into LangChain `Document` object, enriched with metadata for downstream processing.

4. **Fallback Mechanism**  
   - When the LLM determines a query cannot be answered using the schema, it returns `None` to avoid unnecessary computations or invalid results.

5. **Integration with other retrievers**
   - as the graph_retriever offers the most enriched data source, when it creates results, it seen as most important and based on the chunk_size (kijk hiervoor naar de code om beter uit te leggen) 

### Implementation details: Graph-based document uploading

two new function: add_csv_to_graphdb, add_document_to_graphdb, 

first add_csv_to_graphdb uitleggen

add_document_to_graphdb uitleggen, leg hierbij ook uit dat je met een environment variable kan instellen of je de schema wil definiÃ«ren in de .env file of dynamisch wil krijgen uit de database. 



# End-to-end functionality

We have created an end-to-end functioning graphdb implementation of RAG, which can upload both csv and pdf files.
